			<p>If you are looking to find out more about John DeWolf, you've come to the right place. Here you can find my resume, a brief section about who I am, and other bits of information. I'll be honest, the main goal of this site is to better control my SEO, since "John DeWolf" appears to be a popular name (I'm looking at you <a href="">John DeWolf</a>, dutch soccer player.)</p>

			<h2>Allow me to introduce myself...</h2>
			<p>Hello Internet! A brief introduction: I graduated from Endicott College in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science in Communication and a concentration of Advertising. While at Endicott, I was a member of Lambda Pi Eta, the National Communication Honor Society. I also completed three internships, each of which helped shape my education and spark an interest in the advertising/marketing field. My time at Project HEALTH (now Health Leads USA) gave me not only valuable experience but also an appreciation for the positive affect that nonprofits can have on a community. Upon graduation, I was fortunate enough to find a job at Raceway Media as the Marketing Coordinator.</p>

			<p>While here I had a variety of responsibilities that ranged from marketing to advertising operations to production of creative assets.  My time at Raceway Media (now Internet Brands after a 2012 purchase), proved to be a valuable opportunity to get first hand experience in advertising operations. However, in 2012 I chose to pursue an opportunity at Yahoo! as a Media Delivery Coordinator. Working at Yahoo! has proven to be a great opportunity, I really like how this position focuses on the more technical aspect of advertising operations.</p>

			<p>Beyond my career I have many passions that drive me. I am devoted to maintaining relationships with my friends and family.   In July I moved to Portland, as my father likes to say "with nothing but a suitcase and a toothbrush" (and my girlfriend, but let's not group her in the same category.)  So right now, I'm trying to take it all and devour all the weirdness that this city has to have to offer.</p>
