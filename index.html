				<h2>Allow me to introduce myself...</h2>
				<p>Hello Internet! In case you haven't figured it out yet, my name is John DeWolf... or Jack DeWolf... or JD. Beyond being a man of many names, I am also a man of many interests and talents. </p>

				<p>I like messing around with Internet things. I am web developer with five years of digital marketing experience. Rails, Drupal, Wordpress, and Front End languages are in the realm of my expertise. However, I like to do more than getting projects built and looking pretty, I am always looking for ways to optimize them and improve their performance. I also love to learn about new web technologies. For example, I typically SASS and Bootstrap, so I built this site with LESS and <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a></p>

				<p>Besides sitting in front my computer I am also a fully functioning human. You can find playing pickup basketball, or hiking mountains, or drinking craft beer.</p>

				<p>Interested in collaborating on a project? Send me an <a href="mailto:jdewolf06@gmail.com">email</a>, I'd love to talk about it.</p>

<!-- 				<p>My career began in 2012 for Raceway Media (now part of Internet Brands after they were acquired), a small company that produces online classified sites for niche markets. There I was the Digital Marketing coordinator and got my first taste of concepts that I would later become much more immersed in.</p>

				<p>From there I had the great opportunity to work for Yahoo!, Inc. I moved to Portland, OR with (as my father likes to say) "with nothing but a suitcase and a toothbrush" (and my girlfriend, but let's not group her in the same category.) I started out with a six month project in which I was the team leader for a six person team. We successfully completed the migration of all online campaigns from their old ad serving to their new, fancy web app.</p>

				<p>I continued to work with Yahoo! after the project, providing techincal support for the new ad serving techonology. When campaigns did not serve as expected, it was our job to figure out why. Maybe it was booked incorrectly or maybe there was a bug in the system? If it was the latter of the two, we worked closely with engineering to pinpoint the problem and make sure it was fixed.</p>

				<p>I really enjoyed my time at Yahoo! and learned a great deal about digital ad serving. It really inspired me to learn more about online technologies. I kept learning in my free time and soon realized it wasn't enough and that I wanted to make a bigger commitment. So I took the dive and enrolled in Launch Academy where I learned Ruby on Rails and how to build web apps.</p>

				<p>Those ten weeks were a real rollercoster. I was introduced to a whole new world and crammed more knowledge into my brain than I ever thought possible. I am now working at Datto, Inc (formerly Backupify, before it was acquired). I am continuing to learn a great deal about web development</p> -->
